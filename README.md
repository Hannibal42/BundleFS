# BundleFS

BundleFS is a compact, FAT like file system for storing the Bundles of the Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050).
It has a small memory footprint and allows fast access of the stored Bundles without unnecessary indirection.
BundleFS was developed for the ÂµPCN Project (http://upcn.eu/) during my bachelor thesis.
